# Python - Flask FrameWork

As we know that the python-flask is a microservice framework. So I have created a small web api server that will provide a user, item and like data.

## Pre Requirement

`pip upgrade python`

`flask`

`flask_sqlalchemy`

`flask-cors`

`psycogy-2`

`python-dotenv`

`Flask-Bcrypt`

## How To Run the Server

- Setup Environment `py -m venv .venv`

- run the command `.venv/Scripts/activate`

Create a new `.env` file on the source folder

- Add Your `DATABASE_URI` key

- Run the server using `py run.py` in the terminal window
